## 💻 Architectural Deep Dive (Showcasing Core Skills)

This project is structured as a powerful **Single Page Application (SPA)** designed to communicate efficiently with a backend service (mocked or real) using industry-standard patterns.

### 1. RESTful API Design (Frontend Focus)

* **Data Handling:** The frontend is built to consume data from a **RESTful API**. This ensures a clear separation of concerns between the UI and data logic.
* **Resource Management:** Implemented logic for handling standard **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for resources like **Products, Orders, and Users**.

### 2. Payment Gateway Integration

* **Secure Checkout:** The `Checkout` process is designed to integrate with a modern payment solution (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
* **Tokenization & Security:** Implementation focuses on passing secure payment tokens (not raw card data) to a hypothetical server endpoint, ensuring **PCI compliance** principles are followed.

### 3. State Management & Data Flow

* **Centralized State:** Uses the **React Context API** for global state (Auth, Cart) and **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server-side state (**caching, automatic data synchronization**).
* **High Code Quality:** The entire project is written in **TypeScript** to ensure **type safety**, reduce runtime errors, and enhance maintainability, showcasing a commitment to professional code standards.
