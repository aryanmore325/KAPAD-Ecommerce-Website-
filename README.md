üíª Architectural Deep Dive (Showcasing Core Skills)
This project is structured as a powerful Single Page Application (SPA) designed to communicate efficiently with a backend service (mocked or real) using industry-standard patterns.

1. RESTful API Design (Frontend Focus)
Data Handling: The frontend is built to consume data from a RESTful API. This ensures a clear separation of concerns between the UI and data logic.

Resource Management: Implemented logic for handling standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for resources like Products, Orders, and Users.

2. Payment Gateway Integration
Secure Checkout: The Checkout process is designed to integrate with a modern payment solution (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

Tokenization & Security: Implementation focuses on passing secure payment tokens (not raw card data) to a hypothetical server endpoint, ensuring PCI compliance principles are followed.

3. State Management & Data Flow
Centralized State: Uses the React Context API for global state (Auth, Cart) and React Query (TanStack Query) for server-side state (caching, automatic data synchronization).

High Code Quality: The entire project is written in TypeScript to ensure type safety, reduce runtime errors, and enhance maintainability, showcasing a commitment to professional code standards.

‚ú® Features
User Facing
